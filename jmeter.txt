How to install jmeter in windows , in mac and in Linux 

main component 
thread - user 
s sampler - method 
  listener - report 

create first jmeter test 
1.start jmeter 
2. create a test plan 
3. create thread group (user) 
4. add a sampler ( http) 
5. add a listeners ( report ) 
6. run test plan 
7. save test plan 


TIMER 

Recording in jmeter 
1. add non testelement - http recording 
2. set proxy on browser 
3. start recording in diffrent recording controller 
4. start scenarios recording 
5. stop recording and save 

simple control  - need to disable it to add in module controler 

module controler 
it is use to call the simple controler before it runs alternative of simple controler is test fragment 

random controler - to run a request randomely

What is Performace testing? 
- Perforamce testing is defined as a type of NOn-Functional software testing to ensure software applications will perfoem well under expected workload.

- The goal of performance testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performace bottlenecks.

- The focus of performance Testing is checking a software program's 
  - speed    - application response quickely 
  - scalability - maximum user a application can handle 
  - stablity - is application is stable in varing load 

- performance testingis populary called 'perf testing'

why do performance testing?
- perrformace testing is done to provide the information to stack holder about the application regarding speed , scalability and stablity 
- moreover performance testing uncover what needs to be improve before application goes to market. without perfoemace testing software is like to suffer from issues such as running slow when several user useage simintaneously, inconsistancy with diffrent operating systems and core usability.
- performace testing will determind weather software need Speed , scalablity and stablity requirements under expected work load.

Type of performance Testing 
- load testing - load testing checks the application ability to perform under anticipated user loads. so the objective is to identify performace bottle neck before the software application 
                 goes live.
-stress testing - stress testing involve testing an application under extreme work load to see how its handle high traffic and data processing so the objective is to identify the breadking point of an application.

-spike testing - spike testing test the software reaction to sudden spikes in the load generated by the users 

-endurance testing -endurance testing is done to check the application can handle the expected load over a long period of time.

-volume testing - under volume testing large number of data is populated in data base and overall system behavior is monitored, so the objective is to check the softeare application performace under varing database volumes 

common performance problems 
- long load time 
- poor response time 
- poor scalability 
- Bottlenecking 

- some common performance bottlenecks are 
 - cpu utilization 
 - memory utilization 
 - network utilization 
 - operating system limitations 
 - Disk usage 


performance testing process 
 
- identify test environment 
- plan and design tests 
- identify performance acceptance criteria 
- configure test environment 
- implement test design 
- execute tests 
- analyze and report 


performance testing metrics: paremeters monitored 

- processor usage - an amount of time processoe spends executinf non-idel threads 
-memory use - amount of phusical memory available to process on a computer 
- disk time - amount of the disk is busy executing a read or wite requests 
- bandwidth - shows the bits per second used bt a network interface 
-private bytes - number of bytes a processor has allocated that can not be shred amongst another processors.these are used to measure memory leaks and usage.
-committed memory - amount of virtual memory used 
-response time - time from when a user enters a request until the first character of the response is received 
-throughput - rate a computer or network receives requests per seconds 
-amount of connection pooling - the number of user requests that are met by pooled connections.the more requests met by connections in the pool, the better the performance will be.
-maximum active sessions - the maximum number of sessions that can be active at once.
hit ratio - this has to do with the number of SQL statements that are handled by each data inseted of espensive I/o operations. this is a good place to start to solving bottlenecking issues 
hits per second - the no. of hits on a web service during each second of a load test 
thread counts - an application health can be measured by the no. of threads that are running and currently active 


Example performance test cases 

-verify rewpinse time is not more then 4 secs when 1000 users access the website simultaneously
-verify response time of the application under load is within an acceptable range when the network connectivity is slow 
-check the maximum number of users that the application can handle before it crashes 
-check database execution time when 500 records are read/written simultaneously 
-check cpu and memoty usage of the application and the database sever under peak load conditions 
-verify response time of the application under low , normal ,moderate and heavy load conditions 

performace testing tools

conclusion 

parameterization data driven testing 

add > config element > user defined variable 
add variable like ${variable name}

by using csv file 
add > config element > CSV Data set config 

correlation 
The process of extracting some value from the response of a step and referring it into the request of another subsequent step is called correlation.

Referencing is done at run time dynamically so it is called  dynamic reference.
add > post processors > regular expression extractor 

in the view result table click on text drop down and can see different test option where we can check the regular expression
